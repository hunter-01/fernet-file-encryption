# fernet-file-encryption
A simple set of scripts for encrypting and decrypting files, designed to be used in terminals


For now the project has 3 files. One for creating keys, one for encrypting the file and one for decrypting.

To encrypt a file, and to decrypt it, a key is needed. The same key is needed for both encryption and decryption.

If you lose the key, you can no longer decrypt the file, and vice versa. Don't lose the key. The script that creates keys is made to create keys randomly, without seeds.

The script that generates the keys, displays them in your terminal and stores them in a file called log-keys.txt

When using the encryption and decryption file it will be necessary to use 2 arguments in the terminal, first the file name and second the key generated by the key creation script.

Be careful:
- Don't lose keys, you may lose your file content permanently;
- Do not change ANYTHING, NOTHING AT ALL, the content of the already encrypted file, when decrypting it will give a completely different result than it was originally, even using the same key used in the encryption. Losing file contents forever.

I think I explained everything, if I remember anything I'll put it here. And I'm not responsible if you do shit using the scripts.

Code comments are in Portuguese (Brazil), soon I will put in English too.

I used the Python language and the Fernet library to make the scripts.
